My name is **Alongkorn  Sumngarm**. People call me Phu which is my nick name. I am studying about computer science at MUIC. This blog is my first assignment for internet programing. For this blog, I wrote about my self and some basic tutorial which is for new programmer. I interest in computer science because there are everywhere and we use it everyday.
