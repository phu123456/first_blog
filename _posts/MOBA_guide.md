At very beginning, you have to know hero's ability like, strength, agility and intelligent (str,agi,int). Once you know, try to pick one hero (str recommended because people will not aiming on you too much because mostly str hero are tanker). When you play, many people will tell you like you are noob and etc but just ignore them because before you are good at this game, everyone were noob before. By the time you are good at one specific hero, you should know other hero skill. This come to the next step. Learn other hero skill and how to buy the right item for you hero. It is very important to know other's hero skill because you know what is coming. The last step is to practice and try to watch competition which you will learn a lot faster.
