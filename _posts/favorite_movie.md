This movie make me curios about what will happen if we have robot that can think like human. This movie is about one man try to create robot that similar to baby. Baby need someone to teach them what is right and wrong. However, that robot were steal by gangster(criminal) which they that baby robot how to steal stuff. After awhile, robot owner try to teach robot that it is not right to do that "it's bad". Robot start to realize what is wrong and right. Robot owner got shot and dying. Robot try to save him by tranfer his concious in to new robot and it success.
Now the owner of robot are in robot and think same as he as a human.
I really want to know what will happen if this is real!!
